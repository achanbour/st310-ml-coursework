# ST310 Machine Learning Code

Practical applications of Machine Learning methods completed during the ST310 seminars at the LSE.

Seminar 1 : Compared linear regression to the more flexible LOESS model to evaluate which model performed better in predicting life expectancy from GDP Per Capita based on the gapminder dataset

Seminar 2: Explored the stastistical concepts behind linear regression using various the ```glance``` function from the broom package. Conducted model analytics on the linear regression model of life expectancy against GDP Per Capita from the gapminder dataset. Diagnostics included : checking for a pattern in residuals to identify systematic bias, plotting the Cook's distance to identify influential points and building the QQ-plot to assess normality in the model.

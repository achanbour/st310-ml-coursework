# ST310 Machine Learning

Course work completed as part of the ST310 module taught at the LSE.


Topics covered: * Regression : Linear, Polynomial.
                * General Linear Models (GLM).
                * Models with high levels of flexibility : eg. Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
                * Models with low levels of flexibility : Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Ridge Regression
                * Prediction on non-numeric qualitative outcomes : Classification, Logistic Regression
                * Optimisation techniques involving Gradient descent, Coordinate descent, Stochastic/Random descent
                * Generalisation and overfitting problems: In Distribution (Overfitting to variance) & Out Of Distribution (Overfitting to bias)
